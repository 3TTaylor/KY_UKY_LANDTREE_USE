## Land Cover and Tree Canopy Analysis for Kentucky and the UK Campus

This project supports a field exercise for comparing remote sensing analysis with field-based tree canopy observations. The maps below were created using ArcGIS Pro, NLCD land cover data, and LiDAR-based elevation models. Each layout has been exported in both JPEG format for web preview and geospatial PDF format for mobile use in the Avenza Maps app.
